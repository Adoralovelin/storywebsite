                            In complete darkness, a small fire lit. This fire was hope, sparked in the middle of sadness and depression. The fire was alone, but he knew that being sad wasn't going to help, because if you wanted things to change, you can't just stand there and hope it happens, you've got to do something, and that's what this small lonely fire did.

                        <p class="text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed mb-6">
                            He ventured into the depths, hoping to find a friend, but no one was there. But this little fire wasn't going to lose hope, as he knew that if you think positive, you can achieve anything. This fire, called Dawn, wasn't going to let the darkness push him down.
                        </p>

                        <p class="text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed mb-6">
                            One unusually warm day, he saw another spark ignite. "Have I finally found a friend?" Dawn thought, and turns out, he did! The new spark started out small, but quickly grew larger in Dawn's presence. "Hello," Dawn started, not wanting to frighten this new spark. "I'm Dawn!" The spark jumped up and down, excited to be meeting someone. Dawn was also overjoyed, as he jumped up and down in return.
                        </p>

                        <p class="text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed mb-6">
                            The new spark was eventually named Light. Light and Dawn became best friends, as there were no one else to be friends with. The world around them began to form, and they had found the first tree. It was like a miracle to them, but little did they know that trees would be all around!
                        </p>

                        <p class="text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed mb-6">
                            As the next day came, Dawn was surprised to see a bunch of trees! Trees started spreading everywhere, and both Dawn and Light loved it. They had found a home, and this is where happiness began. They started making songs and dances, all of them telling how Dawn had begun in sadness, but soon filled the whole world with brightness, when there was supposed to be none.
                        </p>

                        <p class="text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed mb-6">
                            Dawn had figured out one thing, that change doesn't come from nowhere, you've got to make things happen yourself, and he did exactly that, as he had found a friend, built a home, and was now as happy as could ever be. Dawn, the once lonely spark, was now thriving, and had achieved all his goals, this was because he never lost hope, and neither should you.
                        </p>

                            This was a story of how a positive mindset and a little hope could change everything.
